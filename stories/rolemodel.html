		<h1>They Actually Want to Be Like You.</h1>
		<p>“When I started my musical career I was a maid, I used to clean houses. My parents—my mother was a 
		proud janitor, my step-father who raised me like his very own worked at the post office and my father 
		was a trash man. They all wore uniforms. And that’s why I stand here today in my black and white and 
		I wear my uniform to honor them,” – Janelle Monae</p>

		<p>Janelle Monae’s story is very important me because she is a first. She comes from a long line of hard 
		workers, and she realizes what representation means to us. She continues to proudly show her background 
		did not hinder her, but prepared her to be who she is today.</p>

		<p>However, Janelle teaches us another lesson, when she expresses her astonishment when she learns, other 
		girls not only look up to her, but actually WANT to look and be like her.</p>

		<p>Sometimes we get caught up in fighting the stereotypes we end up letting our atmosphere really let us 
		believe we are alone. That we are the only ones who feel this way, that we begin to isolate ourselves. 
		We begin to forget that though we may be far apart, we are not alone. And we all have stories of feeling 
		unacceptable or subpar to society. Share them, and you’ll be amazed at how many people like you are 
		trying to be just like you.</p>
