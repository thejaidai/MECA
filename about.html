					<p><b>What does MECA stand for?</b></p> 
					<p><b>M</b>inority <b>E</b>xperiences in <b>C</b>olorless <b>A</b>tmospheres</p> 
						
					<p><b>What does that mean exactly?… Colorless Atmospheres?</b></p> 
						
					<p>We’ve defined Colorless Atmospheres to mean a place like the moon.
						When many of us our kids we’re told to reach for the moon, and hope 
						to fall on stars, but what happens if we’re the few that actually 
						make it and there’s no one up there that understands your struggles, 
						or your identities? What if you are the only one to make it to the 
						moon? The moon for you may be college, being a professor, the STEM 
						field, or even America! A place or career that seemed impossible for 
						you to grab and now you’re the only one like you there.</p> 
						
					<p><b>This is why MECA was created.</b></p> 
						
					<p><b>MECA</b> was created for ambitious people experiencing the effects of 
						colorless atmospheres. MECA was made with African-Americans in mind, 
						but we’ve realized MECA could be a great forum for others as well.</p>

				<p><b>Valenta Bedford</b></p>
				<p>My name is Valenta. I am an African American woman who works in the technology field. I know what it is like to be the 
				only one in the room who looks like me. I’ve realized working for one of the top technology companies without a technology
				 degree is an anomaly in itself. And to black and female as well is daunting. I know loneliness. I understand and live the 
				 MECA experience. This is my drive to start this website. I want minorities to have a safe space where we can talk together
				  and where we do not feel alone.

				<p><b>Jadel Hughes-Davis</b></p>
				<p>I’m an African-American, First-Generation, Chemical Engineering Female, and I’m tired of feeling alone…. And I know 
				I’m not the only one. I’m Jadel Hughes-Davis, a Michigan State junior studying chemical engineering. Like many others 
				who first start to embark their journey as a first generation anything, I was excited. I was excited to be trailblazing 
				the path for my family and for those who come after me. I was filled with enthusiasm to learn more things and reach places 
				people said were unattainable. However, as I started making my first steps onto that new terrain in my career, the crippling 
				weight of actually being the only started to really bog me down. I started to realize how much identity and representation 
				mattered. Whether it was in class, at an on-campus event, in the cafeteria or at in internship I felt the pressure to be the 
				‘everything’ model for my gender and my minority. People notice the only one and I’ve felt isolated or disassociated from my 
				atmosphere. I’ve realized spending more time on explaining my being than actually being can be crippling. It can be so 
				detrimental that you feel like you want to run back to your comfort zone. You don’t want to swim in un-charted waters any 
				longer. You stop reaching for places where familiarities don’t exist. And that is not my or your end goal! We want to reach 
				for the sky and then leap for the moon! So will you leap with me, and trust me we’ll be here to talk about, so you can go 
				back to being the boss you need to be.</p>
